## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v22+)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (v1.2.0+)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Electron uses node-gyp to build native modules.
>
> You need to [install some dependencies](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for node-gyp to work, or it might fail to build.
